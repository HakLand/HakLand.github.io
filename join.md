**We don't accept members for one-off time-critical project (eg: holiday van build)** - there are commercial workshops you can rent for this purpose elsewhere, eg: The Warren, Gribblehurst Community Shed.

**How to Join**
The hackspace is open to the public weekly on Thursday from 6pm - this is the busiest time and the best for new people visiting. We suggest you start with a tour during these open days to get to know us.
Inductions are run during these open days also. Please confirm on our chat application (slack) a suitable time for an induction.
Once we have confirmed that you are paying weekly fees into our account, we will admit you to our member group where passwords and authourisation for access can be gained. 

**Fees**
Membership costs $20 a week but please pay as much as you feel is fair so the space can survive.
