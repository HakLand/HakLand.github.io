## Grand Re-opening

We've moved to an awesome new location at 21 Newton Road, Grey Lynn, Auckland. It's just round the corner from the junction between K'Road and Ponsonby Road. Come along to our grand re-opening party between **10am and 3pm on Saturday 10th April 2021** to check out the new space!
